# [vim.how](https://vim.how)

This is a searchable catalog of vim commands organized by category. It's built as a PWA that works offline.

I did it as a hobby project to force myself to learn vim and play with some tech. Hopefully in the future it will be more extensive with examples etc.

It is built using React, Next, TypeScript, Tailwind and hosted on Vercel.

```
npm i
