# [vim.how](https://vim.how)

This is a PWA that is a searchable cataloge of vim commands organized by category.

I did it as a hobby project to force myself to finally learn vim. Hopefully in the future it will be more extensive with examples etc.

It is built using React, Next, TypeScript, Tailwind and hosted on Vercel.

Install all dependencies:

```
npm i
```

## Run in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

And go to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

## Build a production bundle

```

## Run in production mode

First build a production bundle, then:
